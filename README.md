# Evolutionary Action-Abstractions.

The framework is divided into three folders:

MicroRTS - It is the microRTS necessary to execute the match that provide de Fitness Function. The user needs to generate the executable jar setting the main class SOARoundRobinTOScale and changing the algorithm that will perform the test. 

Genetic Algorithm - It is the Genetic Algorithm in truth. Here, you can change variables like mutation rate, crossover rate, the number of generations and others. 

Scripts - Here, there are all scripts necessary to run the framework in clusters using torque PBS. 

We advise using the folder Configured Sample as support the initial tests. It is fully configured.
